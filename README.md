# Design with AI Knowledge Map

The Design with AI Knowledge Map is a tool still under development that is intended to help designers in conceptually and ontologically orienting themselves when dealing with the topic of artificial intelligence. It is intended as an open experiment carried out with the collaboration of some students and colleagues in order to release it as an open source tool, open to the interaction with anyone who can contribute. 

This first iteration is just a starting point and the vectorial version will be soon upgraded into a more data-friendly one.

Meanwhile I'm working on [this Miro board](https://bit.ly/49yr3tM) (everyone can leave comments)
